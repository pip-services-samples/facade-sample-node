 * @module persistence
 *
 * Todo: Rewrite this description.
 *
 * @preferred
 * Contains various persistence implementations (InMemory and File â€“persistences). These are
 * "abstract" persistences, which only connect to data sources and do not implement the operations
 * and methods for working the data. The classes that extend these persistences must implement this
 * logic on their own.
 *
 * Identifiable Persistences work with Identifiable objects, which have primary keys. A few standard
 * operations are defined by default for these objects: reading arrays and data pages; searching for
 * an object by its id; and creating, updating, and deleting records of objects.
